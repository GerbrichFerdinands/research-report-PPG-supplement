# PPGtools
The package is currently located a private GitHub repository.
To install ` PPGtools` on your computer, a token has to be generated.
Please follow the instructions from the `devtools` package:


> To install from a private repo, use auth_token with a token
> from https://github.com/settings/tokens. You only need the
> repo scope. Best practice is to save your PAT in env var called
> GITHUB_PAT.

After generating the token, the package can be installed.
```{r}
# generated token
token <- "GITHUB_PAT"

# install package from private GitHub repository
devtools::install_github(GerbrichFerdinands/PPGtools, auth_token = token, build = TRUE)

```

## Step 0. Prepare data 

## Example
```{r}
# prepare data
raw_signal <- prepInput(rec, channel = "Green", tstart = 20, tstop = 40)
``` 

## Step 1. Filter data
```{r}
# smooth series z
lambda <- matrix(10^(seq(1, 7, 2)), dimnames = list(paste0('lambda_', 1:4), NULL))

z <- smoothWE(raw_signal = raw_signal, lambda = lambda, d=2, uni = TRUE)

```

```{r}
# plot results
title <- "Uniform sampling assumed, d=2, lambda = 10, 10^3, 10^5, 10^7"
plotLambda(raw_signal = raw_signal, z = z, title = title)
```
